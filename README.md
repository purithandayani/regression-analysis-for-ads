# regression-analysis-for-ads
In this project, I use regression analysis to predict the product sales from various advertising platform's budget. The dataset that I use here is available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/singhnavjot2062001/product-advertising-data.
It contains advertising cost across various platforms (TV, Billboards, Google Ads, Social Media, Influencer Marketing, and Affiliate Marketing) and the corresponding Product Sold for each cost spent on these advertising platforms.
